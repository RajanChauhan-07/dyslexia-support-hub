              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                At Dyslexia Support Hub, we're dedicated to making reading and learning more accessible for individuals with dyslexia. We believe that dyslexia is not a limitation, but a different way of processing information that comes with unique strengths.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Our mission is to provide tools and resources that work with your unique brain, not against it. We strive to create technology that adapts to your needs, rather than forcing you to adapt to technology.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                Dyslexia is a learning difference that affects how the brain processes written and sometimes spoken language. It's not related to intelligenceâ€”in fact, many people with dyslexia are highly intelligent and creative.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                People with dyslexia often struggle with:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                <li>Decoding words and reading fluently</li>
                <li>Spelling and writing</li>
                <li>Processing and remembering information</li>
                <li>Time management and organization</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                However, dyslexia also brings many strengths, including creativity, problem-solving skills, spatial reasoning, and big-picture thinking.
